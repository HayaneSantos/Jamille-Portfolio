# Jamille-Study-Case
This is a web page created using Html, CSS and Bootstrap. On CSS I incorporated a root with -var()- to change the colour throughout the project. At this point, the project is missing some images that I don't have yet but so far the main part is already done and I am so proud that I am doing this first project all by myself.
